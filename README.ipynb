    "# Client-Server Communication in a Local Wi-Fi Network\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This explanation outlines the process when a client, running on a different PC, connects to a server through the Banyan backplane and IP address within the same Wi-Fi network. The communication is facilitated by the Banyan backplane, acting as an intermediary for message exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Banyan Backplane Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Banyan backplane serves as the communication infrastructure for distributed systems.\n",
    "- Both the client and server scripts use the Banyan backplane for messaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Server Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Server.py` script is executed on a machine within the Wi-Fi network.\n",
    "- The server initializes the BanyanBase with a specified IP address, subscriber port, and publisher port.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Client Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Client.py` script is executed on another machine within the same Wi-Fi network.\n",
    "- The client initializes the BanyanBase with the same Banyan backplane IP address, subscriber port, and publisher port used by the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Connection Establishment\n",
    "\n",
    "- The client and server scripts use the Banyan backplane to establish a connection.\n",
    "- The Banyan backplane facilitates message passing between different processes or machines connected to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Client Name Entry\n",
    "\n",
    "- The client GUI prompts the user to enter their name.\n",
    "- The client sends the entered name to the server through the Banyan backplane using a specific topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Server and Client Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once the client's name is received by the server, the server and client can exchange messages through the Banyan backplane.\n",
    "- The server can broadcast information about items for sale, current bidding status, and the countdown time to all connected clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Bidding and Selling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clients can place bids on items or offer items for sale through the GUI.\n",
    "- The server processes these actions and updates the auction status.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Countdown Timer\n",
    "\n",
    "- The server manages a countdown timer for the auction.\n",
    "- The remaining time is communicated to all clients through the Banyan backplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Winners Announcement\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the countdown reaches zero, the server determines the winners and communicates the results to all connected clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Client GUI Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "- The client GUI updates in real-time based on the messages received from the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. Closing Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clients can close their GUI windows, and the server script can be terminated, closing the communication connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure that the firewall settings on both the server and client machines allow communication through the specified ports.\n",
    "- Use the correct local IP addresses of the machines within the Wi-Fi network.\n",
    "- The Banyan backplane acts as a mediator for communication, and the specified IP address should be reachable by all machines involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup assumes that both the server and client are within the same local network and can communicate with each other using their local IP addresses. If the machines are on different networks, additional configurations, such as port forwarding or VPNs, may be required for successful communication.\n",
